# Angular2Seed
SharePoint Add-In with Angular 2 for Visual Studio 2015 (Seed)

This is a base project for Visual Studio 2015 (Update 2) which incorporates Typescript, NPM and Angular 2 into a SharePoint App

To use the project create any .ts files in the src folder, these will then be saved into the Scripts folder which are subsequently deployed to the SharePoint Add-in.

All new .js files created in the Scripts foler will need to be included in the project for them to work

For Visual Studio 2013 the App will still work but Typescript support and NPM may be depreciated.
